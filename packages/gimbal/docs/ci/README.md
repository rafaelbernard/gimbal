# Gimbal CI Integrations

Gimbal may be executed within a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) service. Each service has it's own differences and Gimbal abstracts those differences making it easy to work within different CIs. These are the currently support CI services and links to their individual documentation pages:

- [Bitbucket Pipelines](./bitbucket)
- [CircleCI](./circleci)
- [TravisCI](./travisci)
